# Add-Sub-lang
Get started in hacktoberfest 2021 by creating add and sub function in 2 of your language.

# What to do?
Create <programming_language>_<username> file eg: cpp_sudipghimire533.cpp
and write two function named `add` and `sub` taking two argument to do addition and substraction operation respectivly.
 
# Example
In c++:
  ```c++
  int add(int lhs, int rhs) {
      int sum = lhs + rhs;
      return sum;
  }
  
  int sub(int big, int small) {
    int difference = big - small;
    return small;
  }
  
  int main(int, char**, char**) {
      std::cout << "Sum of 10 and 20 is: " << add(10, 20) << std::endl;
      std::cout << "Dufference of 20 and 10 is: " << sub(20, 10) << std::endl;
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```
 
 And that's it.
